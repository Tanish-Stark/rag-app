So woocommerce keeps a gap between any 2 ORDER ID\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Hence the next new order ID number is not in sequence. Eg: for orders with partial payment, the next order id number jumps from 4147 to 4150 to 4153 to 4156. Plus for a failed order ID, the order ID number will skip a number. But for GST compliance the Invoice number has to be in sequence, no jumps allowed, so how to manage this? How do we ensure we comply with the GST compliance for generating invoice in sequence?\n\nAnswer from John Son: Hello NEHAL, We will check and let you. Thank you, John"}

Since WordPress 5.2 there is a built-in feature that detects when a plugin or theme causes a fatal error on your site, and notifies you with this automated email. In this case, WordPress caught an error with one of your plugins, WooCommerce GST PRO. First, visit your website ( https://babyandshe.com/ ) and check for any visible issues. Next, visit the page where the error was caught ( https://babyandshe.com/wp-admin/edit.php?s=&post_status=wc-processing&post_type=shop_order&_wpnonce=c042921749&_wp_http_referer=%2Fwp-admin%2Fedit.php%3Fpost_status%3Dwc-processing%26post_type%3Dshop_order%26paged%3D1&action=invoice_downloads&m=0&_customer_user=&paged=1&post%5B%5D=1905&action2=-1 ) and check for any visible issues. Please contact your host for assistance with investigating this issue further. If your site appears broken and you can't access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special \"recovery mode\". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further. https://babyandshe.com/wp-login.php?action=enter_recovery_mode&rm_token=0PLzbRO9ZbVdVdh5SDIUL3&rm_key=ZG23ZK9sQitWwZzo6k1weI To keep your site safe, this link will expire in 1 day. Don't worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires.

But it's not working for the other 2 tax classes GST@18% and GST@12% because these tax classes are empty( https://prnt.sc/112ghiz, https://prnt.sc/112gi1d ). 2.Also for some reason the text shown after the tax is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incl VAT\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which is incorrect. It should show \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incl Tax\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. See the attached screenshot. -It's just because you have selected including tax during cart and checkout( https://prnt.sc/112fv3j ). This is not in our scope but just for help. Add the below code into your activated theme functions.php add_filter( 'gettext', function( $translation, $text, $domain ) { if ( $domain == 'woocommerce' ) { if ( $text == '(incl. VAT)' ) { $translation = '(incl. GST)'; } } return $translation; }, 10, 3 ); 3.Also, how do I set the home state to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153KA\u00e2\u20ac\u009d? -We have set this for you( https://prnt.sc/112fs0i ). 4.what happens if people from outside KA purchase?

Please find the attached invoice. Thank you, John\n\nAnswer from Gautam Ramchandani: John As per law we are required to give MRP (which has to include the GST amount) this is creating two things A confusion for the customer an accounting issue Is it possible for the Discount / coupon column to just the show the value Additionally there is an error IF you look at the invoice you have made for order #3751 It shows product value 2711 / discount 100 / taxable item 2711 (Which should infact be 2711 - 100 = 2611 ) In the Total is showing less 100 (3099 ) the total below is showing 3199 this means that the discount is not being calculated on the product value but it is showing on the product. this is an error If it reduces on the product then the taxable value of the product would reduce by 100 Even if the discount is the card. It should come before the tax is calculated which means it should be on the Total product value then the tax Please look at this I think (I might be wrong ) it is a matter of the formula thanks"}

Workaround for this is you can do this manually for a particular order or you can change Next Invoice No (or) Skip No. 2.The issue with the discount -WIP( Still looking for solution ) Thank you, John"}

In fact it will create a greater issue Do speak with your seniors - Logically all that is need is once the order is processed - i.e. payment successful the invoice only gets generated at that point. What is happening currently it seems as though the invoice is getting generated at check out - In fact it should get generated at payment successful - that is the stage when the order gets placed - Look into this - ASAP Thanks"}

According to the calculation in attachment issue-1.PNG , the total should be 2603, but it is 2637. 2. From the clients' analysis, they\u00c2 feel if the invoice is downloaded for a completed order from the admin portal, it takes the latest values of the product and not the value when the product was actually shipped. For instance, if an order was completed on 1st July and for financial analysis, if the same order invoice is downloaded now, it reflects the current value of the items. [Value of items will change depending on the market needs] This also creates lots of confusion during reconciliation. 3. According to our finance suggestion, the client needs to see the following table in the invoice. This will make it clearer\u00c2 to the user. The current format is getting very confusing as the MRP value is split into multiple categories. Please format the invoice in this manner so the numbers are visible in a clearer format.

Thank you, John\n\nAnswer from ElitemindzPvt Ltd Elitemindz: Howdy! Since WordPress 5.2 there is a built-in feature that detects when a plugin or theme causes a fatal error on your site, and notifies you with this automated email. In this case, WordPress caught an error with one of your plugins, WooCommerce GST PRO. First, visit your website ( https://paintkart.com/ ) and check for any visible issues. Next, visit the page where the error was caught ( https://paintkart.com/wp-admin/edit.php?s=&post_status=all&post_type=shop_order&_wpnonce=ba17ec24ee&_wp_http_referer=%2Fwp-admin%2Fedit.php%3Fpost_type%3Dshop_order&action=mark_completed&m=0&_customer_user=&paged=1&post%5B%5D=8965&action2=mark_completed ) and check for any visible issues. Please contact your host for assistance with investigating this issue further. If your site appears broken and you can't access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special \"recovery mode\". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further. https://paintkart.com/wp-login.php?action=enter_recovery_mode&rm_token=YHfke0Z0cAkUx6u4T5cWEg&rm_key=JzmPR1Qb1dhP6k4dVl2vwA To keep your site safe, this link will expire in 1 day. Don't worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires. When seeking help with this issue, you may be asked for some of the following information: WordPress version 5.7.2 Current theme: Porto Child (version 1.1) Current plugin: WooCommerce GST PRO (version 2.1.1) PHP version 7.3.27 Error Details ============= An error of type E_ERROR was caused in line 9 of the file /home/y0sjxlrwv8qi/public_html/wp-content/plugins/woo-gst/invoice/templates/class-default.php.

According to the calculation in attachment issue-1.PNG , the total should be 2603, but it is 2637. 2. From the clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 analysis, they\u00c2 feel if the invoice is downloaded for a completed order from the admin portal, it takes the latest values of the product and not the value when the product was actually shipped. For instance, if an order was completed on 1st July and for financial analysis, if the same order invoice is downloaded now, it reflects the current value of the items. [Value of items will change depending on the market needs] This also creates lots of confusion during reconciliation. 3. According to our finance suggestion, the client needs to see the following table in the invoice. This will make it clearer\u00c2 to the user. The current format is getting very confusing as the MRP value is split into multiple categories. Please format the invoice in this manner so the numbers are visible in a clearer format. [Please refer to attachment issue-3.PNG ] 4. We also need to add a signature in the invoice. Thank you\n\nAnswer from John Son: Hello Anek , Let's have a google meet today 28th September 2021 at 11:30 AM on the below meeting URL, to discuss the above issue.

Since WordPress 5.2 there is a built-in feature that detects when a plugin or theme causes a fatal error on your site, and notifies you with this automated email. In this case, WordPress caught an error with one of your plugins, WooCommerce GST PRO. First, visit your website ( https://www.traveletics.in/ ) and check for any visible issues. Next, visit the page where the error was caught ( https://www.traveletics.in/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&tab=settings_gst_tab ) and check for any visible issues. Please contact your host for assistance with investigating this issue further. If your site appears broken and you can't access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special \"recovery mode\". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further. https://www.traveletics.in/mainadmin123/?action=enter_recovery_mode&rm_token=YpZ851YORHz9doMMQGqvSW&rm_key=Fxf0DfY9oFwcJ4ba3h1ItF To keep your site safe, this link will expire in 1 day. Don't worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires.

Since WordPress 5.2 there is a built-in feature that detects when a plugin or theme causes a fatal error on your site, and notifies you with this automated email. In this case, WordPress caught an error with one of your plugins, WooCommerce GST PRO. First, visit your website ( https://www.brevetrider.com/ ) and check for any visible issues. Next, visit the page where the error was caught ( https://www.brevetrider.com/wp-admin/post.php ) and check for any visible issues. Please contact your host for assistance with investigating this issue further. If your site appears broken and you can't access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special \"recovery mode\". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further. https://www.brevetrider.com/wp-login.php?action=enter_recovery_mode&rm_token=WyXjcgBgYt21SvtHPRkanU&rm_key=FjvvcTdFG5aqUq1vkj2Oek To keep your site safe, this link will expire in 1 day. Don't worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires. When seeking help with this issue, you may be asked for some of the following information: WordPress version 5.8.2 Current theme: Astra (version 3.7.5) Current plugin: WooCommerce GST PRO (version 2.1.2) PHP version 8.0.11 Error Details ============= An error of type E_ERROR was caused in line 288 of the file /home/ku9cjxi4voqn/public_html/brevetrider.com/wp-content/plugins/woo-gst/invoice/vendor/dompdf/dompdf/src/FrameReflower/AbstractFrameReflower.php.

The PDF library that we use is not compatible with PHP 8.0 yet. Generally speaking, I would recommend sticking with PHP7.4 for a couple of months until all systems are compatible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as you can see we too are tied to third-party libraries that need to be updated. Let me know if you solve this issue! Thank you, John"}

Give your billing address out of Kerala state and it should generate a IGST invoice.  Once you do a test order you will come to know the issue clearly.

Your license is no longer active as it is expired on 2022-08-25 August 2022. 2. Check the GST pdf settings. 3.

Re...", "section": "Customer Support", "source": "woocommercegst.co.in/support", "content": "Question from John Son: Hello Ruchir, We are waiting for your response. Regards, John\n\nAnswer from RUCHIR AGARWAL: Hi John Actually, I was trying to explore the PDF settings mentioned above. I have renewed the license now. With respect to this none of your settings allow for e-invoice. I don't think the concept of e-invoice is clear with Stark Digital. E-Invoicing is mandatory for companies in India above a certain revenue threshold. It is a direct link between the seller and the government where a product once sold and the invoice generated, the same invoice reflects in the Government Portal. This has been done to prevent any frauds or cheating and ensuring clear tax payments. (Strongly recommended you educate yourself and your team about the local laws) This can be done via a simple API and many other stores like Shopify are offering this for free. We are happy to offer you the API and it simply needs to be added to the plugin!! Infact you should be paying me for educating the entire Stark Digital Team about the grave laws they are breaking by selling an incorrect plugin. In case you are successful in doing the API integration. I am making it abundantly clear that Stark Digital will be liable to pay me for helping them develop a software that is mandatory for Indian Laws. It is solely me who has pointed this out to stark digital and its team. What is the point of charging 3000 INR PER YEAR when your plugin does not comply with the     local mandatory laws. Please suggest ways forward. GST \u00e2\u20ac\u201c E Invoice | National Informatics Centre (www.nic.in) - E-Invoice E-way Bill Rules in GST | Tally Solutions - E-way Bill"}

Because if simple the error could be rectified by refund of 3000 INR I would have accepted. As per your blog I had taken service in 2021 for premium and further renewed this time additionally assuming E-Invoice is there and is being done. However it is not. In fact I am not looking to argue here. Let us find a win win solution for RIYO and Stark Digital. Now your team is aware that your plugin doesnt do this. There is a very simple solution to this !! You need to tie up with a GSP ( GST Service Provider) GST Suvidha Provider (GSP) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c An Overview (cleartax.in) List of GSP Approved by the GSTN (cleartax.in) I will provide an API from my end and it can be linked. If you are able to do this I am sure you can charge a premium further to customers !!! We are paying our current ERP provider 5000 INR  a year for 2000 invoices. Think of the revenue you can earn. Infact you should compensate me with some amount for improving your software and helping Stark Digital improve their plugin and earn more revenue.\n\nAnswer from John Son: Hello Ruchir, I really appreciated your suggestions with respect to e-invoicing, and we value every one of our customers. I spoke with my Tech team, and we haven't given the e-invoicing feature to premium as most of our clientele is different. We provide this e-invoicing on special requests by charging extra to the customers. Before the renewal of your license, we did inform you that this is not one of our existing features, on this ticket itself. Please check the ticket thread. However, if you want, we can customize it by charging extra, OR we will refund you the latest purchase only within 7 days, i.e., valid until June 20, 2023, from the date of renewal if you need it. We haven't mentioned it anywhere in our features list, and blogs are just for awareness purposes, that doesn't mean we make this feature public. These are the only possible solutions I could offer you as of now. Kindly let me know your response. Regards, John"}

To apply the fix, please follow these steps: Navigate to the following location on your server: /wp-content/plugins/woo-gst/invoice/class-gst-woocommerce-invoice.php . Locate the line of code that reads require_once \"vendor/autoload.php\"; . Replace that line of code with the following: if (!class_exists('WPO_WCPDF')) { require_once \"vendor/autoload.php\"; } This change ensures that the autoloader is only loaded if the WPO_WCPDF class is not already defined.

Also, please provide us an update on the first point of the previous message regarding the admin email in the invoice.\n\nAnswer from John Son: Hello Kaberi, I wanted to bring to your attention that the GSTIN field is available on the default WooCommerce checkout page, as illustrated in the following screenshot: Screenshot . You can check it in Pages > Checkout > click on edit with Elementor However, since you are using the Funnel Kit store checkout template, it overrides the default WooCommerce checkout page, which is causing the issue. I understand that you prefer not to change the template, but please note that the GSTIN feature is integrated with the default WooCommerce checkout and enables users to enter their GSTIN number when placing an order. This could be quite useful for you. If you choose to keep the current template, I recommend consulting with your developer to explore potential workarounds. We are happy to assist with this if needed. Additionally, regarding the email field on the invoice template: please note that it is a generic template. Customizations will incur an additional charge. You may either hire a developer for this or make the changes yourself. Best regards, John"}

It looks like the GST ...", "section": "Customer Support", "source": "woocommercegst.co.in/support", "content": "Question from John Son: Thank you for reaching out. It looks like the GST is being reflected in the booking emails from the dashboard. This could be due to the WooCommerce GST plugin settings or a customization in your email templates. We recommend checking the following steps to resolve the issue: 1.WooCommerce GST Plugin Settings : Go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard \u00e2\u2020\u2019 WooCommerce \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Settings \u00e2\u2020\u2019 GST. Ensure that the GST calculation settings are configured correctly based on your store's location and taxation rules. 2.Email Template Customization : Check if there are any customizations in the WooCommerce email templates that might be displaying the GST. You can go to WooCommerce \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Settings \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Emails , and from there, select the specific email template that handles order details or booking confirmations. If you find any customizations, you can reset them to default or modify them as needed. 3.WooCommerce Tax Settings : Navigate to WooCommerce \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Settings \u00e2\u2020\u2019 Tax , and verify that the tax options, including GST, are set as per your business requirements. If you don't want GST to appear in the booking email, you can configure tax display options to exclude taxes in customer-facing emails. 4.Check for Plugin Conflicts : Sometimes, other plugins can interfere with the tax settings. You can temporarily disable other plugins (especially those related to bookings, invoicing, or customizations) and check if the issue persists. If you're unsure about any of the above steps, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist further.\n\nAnswer from Suresh Kumar: It it possible to connect call by 2:30 PM"}

You can set the starting invoice number by entering the desired number in the Next Invoice No or Skip No field.

If you require \"00\" in the invoice number, you can add it in the Invoice Prefix field. For instance, entering a prefix like \"SO/24-25/ 00\".

Your product is useless to us. Instead of delivering the updated product today, you have told us that it is not possible to do it. Its really unprofessional and unethical. Really unhappy and dissatisfied with the kind of product and support you are providing. I have given you enough time for the resolution and you have clearly wasted my time and it is unacceptable. While selling the product, you have not mentioned anywhere about its limitation and provided false information about providing support as required. We are an ecommerce startup and time is very valuable to us and you have clearly failed to provide product and support on time. Please cancel the license and provide refund as it is a useless product.  Thanks\n\nAnswer from John Son: Hi Nihar, Thank you for your message. We genuinely regret that our product and support did not meet your expectations, and we understand your frustration regarding the delay and the unmet requirements.
